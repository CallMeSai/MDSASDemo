Tasks

  * Overview and solution layout
  * Consume the IValidation interface and create a validator to validate
    the unique number field.
  * Update the repo to save the user to a sql table

Is 10 numeric digits in length. The tenth digit is a check digit used to
confirm its validity. The check digit is validated using the Modulus 11
algorithm and the use of this algorithm is mandatory.

*Step 1* Multiply each of the first nine digits by a weighting factor as
follows:
Digit Position (starting from the left) 	Factor

1						10

2						9

3						8

4						7

5						6

6						5

7						4

8						3

9						2

*Step 2* Add the results of each multiplication together.

*Step 3* Divide the total by 11 and establish the remainder.

*Step 4* Subtract the remainder from 11 to give the check digit.

If the result is 11 then a check digit of 0 is used. If the result is 10
then the number is invalid and not used.

*Step 5* Check the remainder matches the check digit. If it does not,
the number is invalid.
